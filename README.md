## Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the road accidents that occurred in the year 2021 and 2022 in the United Kingdom. By analyzing various KPIs, i seek to identify trends, make data-driven recommendations.

## Dataset used
Road Accident Data: The primary data used for this analysis is the "Road Accident Data.xlsx" file, containing detailed information about each road accidents that occurred during 2021 and 2022

## Exploratory Data Analysis (KPIs)
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer the key questions, such as:

-Primary KPIs
  - Total Casualities taken place after the accident
  - Total Casualities & percentage of total with respect to accident severity and maximum casualities by type of vehicle

-Secondary KPIs
  - total Casualities with respect to vehicle type
  - Monthly trend showing comparison of casualities for current year and Previous Year
  - Maximum casualities by Road Type
  - Distribution of total casualities by Road surface
  - Relation between Casualities by Area/Location & by Day/Night

## Process
- Data cleaning
- Data processing by adding some customized columns in data
- Data Analysis by Pivot tables and Excel Functions
- Data visualisation to create charts and custom sheets  to show the insights
- Report/ Dashboard creation from start to end

## Project Insight
- The total casualties for the year 2021/2022 was 417883 with 2021 recording more casualities (222146) than 2022 (195737). This could be as a result of a shift in population demographics or as a result of COVID as people became more comfortable with emptier roads.
- The total casualties was further analysed and grouped into fatal,serious and slight casualties. This therefore showed that slight casualties recorded the most accidents (351436), an 84.1% from the total casualties. This was followed by Serious Casualties (59312), 14.2% and Fatal Casualties (7135), 1.7% from the total casualties.
- With respect to vehicle type, car recorded the highest casualities (333485), a 79.8% while others like agricultural vehicle, bus, vans, bikes and others contributed to the 20.2%. This is because people tend to use cars more than other vehicles because of factors like high speed, lightweight.
- The current year (CY) vs previous year (PY) casualties monthly trend indicates potential seasonal patterns in accidents. Both 2021/2022 show a general upward trend in casualties, peaking around june and july. Also, it was recorded that in January to March, 2021 had slightly higher casualties compared to 2022. Meanwhile 2022 saw a significant increase in casualties between September to December compared to 2021. Between April to August, 2021 and 2022 show similar trends with minor fluctuations.
- It was discovered that the road type that recorded the most accidents was Single carriageway with numbers amounting to 309.7k.This was followed by Dual carriageway with 67.4k, Roundabout with 26.8k, one-way street with 7.4k and slip road wuth 6.6k. This is due to the head-on collisions single carriageways have which are often severe and fatal. It could be also be as a result of overtaking, limited visibility and road conditions.
- The chart analysis showed that dry surface (279445) caused the most accidents. This maybe due to factors such as speed, tire wear, skidding and vehicle maintenance.
- Casualties by Area/Location into rural and urban showed that the urban areas recorded more accidents (255.9k) which is more than the number of accidents recorded in the rural areas (162.0k). This is due to the higher traffic volume and congested roads, bad road conditions and pedestrians traffic.
- It was also discovered that accidents occurred more in the daylight (305.0k) compared to the dark (112.9k). This is because drivers tend to use the car more during the day and are exposed to more opportunities for accidents. it can also be traced to other factors such as distraction, speed and bad road conditions.

## Recommendations
Based on the insights, i recommend the following actions:
- Government should improve road conditions, including proper signage and road markings
- They should also construct pedestrian walkways and cycle lanes to separate vulnerable road users
- promote awareness campaigns about road safety and the consequences of reckless driving
- promote public transportation and alternative modes of transport to reduce the car usage
- and also, invests in infrastructures that supports these modes of transportation.

## Conclusion 
The analysis of the UK road accident offers critical insights into different casualties and monthly trends. These findings enables the stakeholders to make informed decisions to reduce the accidents rates in the subsequent years. By implementing these recommendations, the rate of accident will not only decrease but the total welfare of citizens will be ensured.
